 * The Quicksort implementation will use the Quicksort algorithm for dividing
the list of elements to be sorted into a left half and a right half based on the position
of the pivot value.

when the list to be sorted
falls within some threshold value (for example, the list is size 100 or fewer, you
cannot hard code how many times a new thread is created), directly apply a
simple algorithm such as the Selection or Insertion sort.
